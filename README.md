# simple-node-app-with-express
This is an Node.js app build with Express.
At this stage you can download it to your machine, instal nm packages if something is not on your machine and run it 
on your terminal. You can see on terminal now how the added product will be visible as an array-object. 
In the near future this should become an functional CRUD app(CRUD = create, read, update and delete) and you will see the added product
right on the webpage, where it should be visible.
